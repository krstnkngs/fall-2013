Stat 157 Participation Guidelines
=================================

Participation with your Classmates
----------------------------------

Here are some considerations for how to become a successful team in
this course.

Please read: http://goo.gl/vsEk2U

1) Before evaluating a member's contribution, others check their
assumptions to ensure they have properly understood.

2) Each person speaks on his or her own behalf and lets others speak
for themselves.

3) When the group is not working well together it devotes time to
finding out why and makes the necessary adjustments.

4) Conflict [and misunderstanding] is inevitable but will be managed
and dealt with positively.

Consider (1) what is the misunderstanding of the situation and (2)
what are the options to resolve it, before consulting the instructor
or GSI.

Do not fall behind. Do not let your teammates fall behind. Keep each
other accountable.

It is essential that you work as a group and keep each member *on the
same page* before moving onto the next step in an assignment so that
no one is left behind. You are expected to identify the roadblocks,
announce your struggle *early*, consider the options, try to solve the
problem, and ask for help if the options you've tried don't work.




Participating in the Open Source Community
------------------------------------------

In this course you will regularly participate in the Open Source
community by reading blogs, asking (and answering) questions in forums
such as StackOverflow, IRC, and project mailing lists. You will be
expected to learn the rules (both written *and* unwritten) that exist
in these communities when asking for help and when participating


Participating with Scientists and Researchers
---------------------------------------------

In the course of your work in this class you may interact with
scientists and researchers, both here at Cal, as well as across the
world. You are expected to conduct yourself with professional and to
be mindful and respect the time and involvement with your
collaborators.

Participating with the Public
-----------------------------

Because everything we're doing is out in the open it's possible you
may engage with members of public, either as passive onlookers or
actively engaging. Please make your GSIs and Instructors aware of your
interactions with other people and report any harassment immediately.
